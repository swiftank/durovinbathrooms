<h1>Shipping</h1> 
<p>Please be aware that all delivery times quoted are based on when your order leaves the warehouse and not from the time you originally placed your order. Due to this we ask that you do not arrange to have an installer on site until after your order has arrived and you have checked all goods. We do not pay installation costs in the event that the product is damaged in transit or is not suitable for any reason, so it is important to ensure everything is in order before you begin the installation process. </p> 
<p>In the unfortunate event that a product cannot be delivered within the quoted timescale we will contact you to make you aware and if at any point you wish to have a delivery update we will provide you with the tracking number directly on your order and by request at any time, also any other relevent information such as scheduled time slot or courier contact number can be requested and provided where available. </p> 
<b><u>Delivery Methods</u></b> 
<p>We use a number of couriers to deliver your order, and the courier responsible for delivery will depend on what you order and where your order is being delivered to. Orders placed after 2PM with next day delivery selected will not be processed until the following day and then dispatched for delivery the day after.</p>

	<p><b><u>What happens if you miss your delivery?</u></b></p>
	<p>If it is a small or medium item, the courier will attempt to delivery again and will also leave a card for you to arrange a suitable day if possible. If it is a large item there will be one delivery attempt made, if unsuccessful they will have to rearrange delivery which may incur a charge. Some Royal Mail and Parcelforce orders that you miss, you may have to collect from your local depot/Post Office. However, if the item was not received and has been returned back to us damaged, we will be unable to make any refunds.</p> 
	<p>Please DO NOT refuse the delivery. Contact our customer team if you have any problems or need help. The surcharge will be incurred if the delivery refused.</p>
